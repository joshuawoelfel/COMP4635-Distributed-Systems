# COMP 4635 - Distributed Systems Projects

This repository contains two advanced projects completed for the "COMP 4635 - Distributed Systems" course at Mount Royal University. Each project is focused on developing a robust client-server distributed application for a phrase guessing game, implementing microservices architecture, advanced server management techniques, and request/response communication with TCP, UDP, and Java RMI. 
## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Java Phrase Guessing Game with Microservices

This project develops a Java-based distributed application for a phrase guessing game. It features multiple microservices including a game server and an indirection server to handle client requests and facilitate communication using TCP and UDP.
